# CSV Exercises

## Level I

Simple exercises using a very small data set. Each exercise includes a CSV file, and the problem will be solved using two objects: One that represents a single _thing_, a single row of data, and a second object that manages the collection of those things.

The [step-by-step tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/csv/i.html) walks you through the process.

## Level II

These exercises build on those in Level I. There is more data in the CSV file, and it adds more complex behavior to the system.

The [tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/csv/ii.html) explains the execise and provides hints.

## Level III

Each of these exercises uses multiple CSV files containing related data.
