# CSV Exercises

## Round 1

Simple exercises using a very small data set. Each exercise includes a CSV file, and the problem will be solved using two objects: One that represents a single _thing_, a single row of data, and a second object that manages the collection of those things.

### PhoneBook

Follow [the step-by-step tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/intro-to-csv.html) to get a feel for how we are solving the problem.

If you want to look at the completed code and tests, they're in the directory named `phone_book_solved`.

### Follow-On Exercises

The exercises should be solved in the following order:

* ShoppingList
* ReportCard
* DoctorsOffice
* Calendar

Each exercise leaves more and more up to you.

## Round 2

Make sure that there are no changes on your current branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Exercise 1"
```

Check out the `level-ii` branch:

```bash
git fetch origin
get checkout -t origin/level-ii
```
